So, let's get started. Good luck.

TODO:
 1. Firstly, I need to implement the sql client for
    data storing. It must be universal client in order to provide
    possible changing of database system. So I think, must it be nice
    architecture with one interface StoreClient and a lot of descendants,
    for example SQLiteStoreClient.
    Also, it might be the async class, because, maybe, I'll realise the server
    using Beazley's curio.
    ...
 2. Secondly, I need to implement the server. I guess it will be asynchronous
    server using Beazley's curio. Maybe it's so bad idea, but I want to do some
    weird thing.
    What about the structure, it is a good question. Maybe I need to use the
    STUN servers for getting the real ip (for NAT). I think it's the hardest
    part of the work, if I want to do it nice.
    ...
 3. When the console version will be done, I need to implement the graphical
    interface using kivy. One more piece of shit for me.
    ...
 4. Also don't forget the testing and configuration files.
